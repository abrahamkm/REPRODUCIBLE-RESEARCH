Loading the libraries and data from the working directory
activity<-read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE)
Mean total number of steps taken per day
(ignoring the missing values in the dataset)

Calculating the total number of steps taken per day

Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

Computing mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day



Mean of the total number of steps taken per day
## [1] 9354.23
Median of the total number of steps taken per day
## [1] 10395
Average daily activity pattern
Time series plot of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

Finding 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, containing the maximum number of steps



Maximum value of steps taken and time interval in which maximum value is attaned
## [1] 179.1311
## [1] 104
Imputing missing values
Calculating and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)

Strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset is to use the mean for that 5-minute interval.

Creating a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

Making a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

Calculating and reporting the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.

No. of cases with NA values
## [1] 2304


New Mean of the steps taken
## [1] 10580.72
New Median of the steps taken
## [1] 10395
The Mean has changed with inputting for the missing values while the Median has stayed the same.

Differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends
Creating a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels ??? ???weekday??? and ???weekend??? indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

Making a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = “l”) of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).
